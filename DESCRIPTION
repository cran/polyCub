Description: Numerical integration of continuously differentiable
    functions f(x,y) over simple closed polygonal domains.
    The following cubature methods are implemented:
    product Gauss cubature (Sommariva and Vianello, 2007,
    <doi:10.1007/s10543-007-0131-2>),
    the simple two-dimensional midpoint rule
    (wrapping 'spatstat' functions),
    adaptive cubature for radially symmetric functions via line
    integrate() along the polygon boundary (Meyer and Held, 2014,
    <doi:10.1214/14-AOAS743>, Supplement B),
    and integration of the bivariate Gaussian density based on
    polygon triangulation.
    For simple integration along the axes, the 'cubature' package
    is more appropriate.
